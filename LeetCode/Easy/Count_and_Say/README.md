<h1>Merge Two Sorted Lists</h1>
<p>Problem from LeetCode.</p>
 
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following: <br>
<br>
1.     1		<br>
2.     11		<br>
3.     21		<br>
4.     1211		<br>
5.     111221	<br>
<br>
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.					<br>
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.				<br>
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.	<br>
<br>
Given an integer n, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. <br>
