<h1>Reddit Challenge - Intermediate #277 - Fake Coins</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Your job is to find the best conjunctionâ€”that is, find the word with the most sub-words inside of 
it given a list of English words. Some example include:
</p>
<ul> - Something (3 words: So, me, thing)</ul>
<ul> - Awesomeness (3 words: awe, some, ness) </ul>

<h3>Bonus</h3>

<p>
Each sub-word must include the last letter of the previous subword. 
For example "counterrevolutionary" would become "count, terre, evolution, nary"
</p>
<p>
Instead of simply the last letter, allow any number of letters to be shared between words 
(e.g. consciencestricken => conscience, sciences, stricken
</p>
