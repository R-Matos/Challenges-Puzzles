<h1>Ponder This - July 2017</h1>
<p>Challenge from IBM.</p>
 
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This month's challenge is based on an idea from Omid Motahed (thanks!).<br>
<br>
Find a way to assign a unique digit to each letter such that the 863,172nd digit after 
the decimal point of sin(PONDER) and of sin(THIS) are not zeros, but more than a fifth of the 
first million digits of sin(PONDER)*sin(THIS) are zeros.<br>
<br>
The parameters are in degrees, and we count the digits from 1, so for example, sin(100) = 0.9848077530122... 
so the fifth digit after the decimal point of sin(100) is zero.
